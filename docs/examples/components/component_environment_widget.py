"""
The `EnvironmentWidgetBase` class enables you to manage variable values from a
combination of

- custom variable values
- environment variables
- user input.

(listed by order of precedence)

You can use it as a drop in replacement for `os.environ`.

For example you might not have the resources to provide an `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`WEAVIATE_API_KEY` or `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`. In that case you would would like to ask the
user for it.

Inherit from this widget to create your own custom `EnvironmentWidget`.
